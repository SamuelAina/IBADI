00:00:22.007 --> 00:00:26.002
Debo! Comme on, follow me

5
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.008
Carry the chair properly
don't let it get scratched!

6
00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:39.005
Be careful, okay.
Come on lets go!

7
00:00:46.007 --> 00:00:49.003
Take care with that chair, please.

8
00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:48.000
(Debo bids farewell to his childhood friend, Amaka
He gives he his favorite toy)

00:01:56.006 --> 00:02:25.003
Intro of cast...

10
00:02:34.007 --> 00:02:34.009
Hi boss

11
00:02:35.004 --> 00:02:38.000
Hey, how are you?

12
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.004
This is for the Bensons

13
00:02:43.004 --> 00:02:45.005
That's for a detached bungallow

14
00:02:45.005 --> 00:02:51.005
For 3-bedrooom flats...
A generator room...

15
00:02:51.005 --> 00:02:54.009
A garage that can accomodate 1 or 5 cars

16
00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:59.003
...and a compound that is about half a plot

17
00:02:59.003 --> 00:03:02.000
Wow! that the size of an estate.

18
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.003
Yes, boss
awaiting your inspection

19
00:03:06.003 --> 00:03:08.001
You mean.. they're now ready?

20
00:03:08.001 --> 00:03:12.006
Yes, they are. They're on their way
They should be there in an hour

21
00:03:12.006 --> 00:03:16.006
Okay
Let me send this mail...

22
00:03:22.002 --> 00:03:25.001
Girls, that movie was very interesting

23
00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:25.009
Which movie

24
00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:28.001
The one we saw today

25
00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:34.001
That movie was so boring...
The only thing that saved it was that funny actor

26
00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:41.005
Busayo! Don't be so harsh.
The movie had other good actors

27
00:03:41.005 --> 00:03:47.001
Well that's your own opinion.
Hey Jane, what do you think?

28
00:03:47.001 --> 00:03:52.005
Well, you know I'm not interested in movies

29
00:03:52.005 --> 00:03:56.004
Why are you looking at me like that?

30
00:03:56.004 --> 00:04:01.006
Just look at her!
Boring girl!

31
00:04:01.006 --> 00:04:03.003
(A knock on the door)

32
00:04:03.003 --> 00:04:06.002
Let me get the door

33
00:04:23.008 --> 00:04:36.001
Hello ladies!

34
00:04:36.001 --> 00:04:39.002
(Busayo teases Sola)

35
00:04:39.002 --> 00:04:40.008
Should I get you a drink

36
00:04:40.008 --> 00:04:47.003
No, I'm fine.
I just stoped by to say hello

37
00:04:47.003 --> 00:04:50.000
This is for you

38
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.005
Thank you
I really appreciate this

39
00:04:56.005 --> 00:04:56.005
You bought only one gift!

40
00:04:56.005 --> 00:05:03.007
Busayo, common let go

41
00:05:03.007 --> 00:05:04.003
No, I want my own gift too

42
00:05:04.003 --> 00:05:09.006
Okay Busayo. 
I'll get you yours, I promise

43
00:05:09.006 --> 00:05:09.006
Fine boy!!

44
00:05:09.006 --> 00:05:17.009
The last set of people that were promised
they're still in the hospital!

45
00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:19.007
Hmm. Tell her.

46
00:05:19.007 --> 00:05:24.002
Look, I do not fail to keep my promises

47
00:05:24.002 --> 00:05:33.003
Okay, Jane. 
Just so I don't get crucified I'll get yours too

48
00:05:33.003 --> 00:05:38.004
Okay, I have to be on my way now

49
00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:41.000
I tought you came to spend a bit of time with us

50
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.009
Maybe I should have.
But then I was almost not allowed by Busayo to sit
 
51
00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:46,009
Anyway, I'm just joiking
I have to be on my way now though

51
00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:58.000
(Jane and Busayo bid Sola farewell, Amaka sees him off)

52
00:06:12.006 --> 00:06:12.006
(Sola wants to say something but he's toungtied)

53
00:06:12.006 --> 00:06:35.000
Do you want to say something?

54
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
(Sola stutters)

55
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.002
You must be very tired
You need to go home and rest

56
00:06:49.001 --> 00:06:50.006
Okay

57
00:06:50.006 --> 00:06:50.006
Bye

58
00:06:50.006 --> 00:06:53.009
Bye

59
00:06:53.009 --> 00:06:58.003
(Sola hesitates)

60
00:06:58.003 --> 00:07:03.002
Bye!

61
00:07:03.002 --> 00:07:07.008
(Amaka mutters)
What's wrong with this guy?

62
00:07:11.004 --> 00:07:19.007
(The girls giggle as Amaka returns)

63
00:07:19.007 --> 00:07:24.002
Why are you girls laughing

64
00:07:24.002 --> 00:07:28.006
Whats funny?

65
00:07:28.006 --> 00:07:35.003
Babe, you mean the whole drama that just unfolded 
between you and Sola is not enough to make me laugh?

66
00:07:35.003 --> 00:07:35.003
Even me I dont understand Sola
But I hope I will someday

67
00:07:35.003 --> 00:07:42.008
Don't worry God will help you 
The man is a mystery

68
00:07:42.008 --> 00:07:42.008
Amen, amen

69
00:07:42.008 --> 00:07:50.003
Well let me go and get something to eat

70
00:07:59.005 --> 00:07:59.005
(Sola is rehersing what he wants to say to Amaka)

71
00:07:59.005 --> 00:08:11.006
Each time I set my eye on you...

72
00:08:11.006 --> 00:08:14.004
Everytime we're together I...

73
00:08:14.008 --> 00:08:32.003
Amaka...

74
00:08:32.003 --> 00:08:35.005
Amaka please...

75
00:08:36.005 --> 00:08:38.000
How ever it...

76
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.000
I want you to see my heart 
and what I feel for you

77
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:51.008
...come rain, come sunshine
you're the woman I will always want yo be with

78
00:09:01.009 --> 00:09:06.008
dont you see how much I really
want to spend the rest of my life with you?

79
00:09:14.004 --> 00:09:24.001
(Debo is driving along and enjoying some music)

80
00:10:22.008 --> 00:10:25.003
Let me tell you something

81
00:10:25.003 --> 00:10:26.009
I'm not in the right frame of mind now

82
00:10:26.009 --> 00:10:30.002
I wish things were the other way round
It would have been better...

83
00:10:30.002 --> 00:10:32.004
Look!

84
00:10:32.004 --> 00:10:34.008
Look at that!

85
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.004
Now that's a fine girl!

86
00:10:45.004 --> 00:10:47.004
You know what?
Watch a master at work!

87
00:10:49.001 --> 00:10:53.001
(David goes to chat with the lady)

88
00:10:55.007 --> 00:11:18.001
This guy is damn crazy!

89
00:11:18.001 --> 00:11:45.009
How does this work?

90
00:11:45.009 --> 00:11:48.009
Wow!

91
00:11:48.009 --> 00:11:49.009
What? Even a hug?

92
00:12:06.006 --> 00:12:12.004
(Amaka is waiting for a Sola)

93
00:12:50.002 --> 00:12:52.007
Hello beautiful!

94
00:12:52.007 --> 00:12:55.007
Hello!

95
00:12:55.007 --> 00:12:56.004
Where are yo headed?

96
00:12:56.004 --> 00:12:59.009
Debo!

97
00:12:59.009 --> 00:13:04.002
Amaka!!

98
00:13:04.002 --> 00:13:12.007
Adebowale Ademola!

99
00:13:12.007 --> 00:13:14.000
Is this you?

100
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.005
Oh yes, its me in the flesh!

101
00:13:16.005 --> 00:13:17.008
Its over 10 years now..

102
00:13:17.008 --> 00:13:19.006
Yes something like that, where have you been?

103
00:13:19.006 --> 00:13:25.003
I've been around,though I haven't been in the neighbourhood
for a while

104
00:13:25.003 --> 00:13:26.003
Where are you headng..

105
00:13:26.003 --> 00:13:26.003
I'm waithing for a friend
He's comming to pick me up

106
00:13:26.003 --> 00:13:32.007
Well you should tell that your friend
that he's been keeping you for too long

107
00:13:32.007 --> 00:13:36.008
I just spoke to him

108
00:13:36.008 --> 00:13:45.001
How about exchanging contacts?

109
00:13:45.001 --> 00:13:50.005
Let me just type it in. Thats it.

110
00:13:50.005 --> 00:13:54.008
How's your mom, by the way?

111
00:13:54.008 --> 00:13:58.007
Mom is fine. She's very well.
She will be so surprised when I tell her I saw you
 
115
00:13:58,007 --> 00:14:01,006
God, she will. And its beem a long time
you're all grown now

112
00:14:03.004 --> 00:14:05.005
So we'll talk again, right?
Sen my regards to her.

113
00:14:05.005 --> 00:14:07.000
Yeah, I will.

114
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:15.001
Bye..
Bye

115
00:14:15.001 --> 00:14:18.006
Mama!

116
00:14:18.006 --> 00:14:18.006
How are you

117
00:14:18.006 --> 00:14:20.008
I'm fine

118
00:14:20.008 --> 00:14:22.004
You seem to be so happy
did you hit the jackpot?

119
00:14:22.004 --> 00:14:26.005
Mama, do you remember Debo?

120
00:14:26.005 --> 00:14:26.009
Which Debo is that?

121
00:14:26.009 --> 00:14:32.008
Debo, We atteneded the same prinary and secodary
We used to walk to school together

122
00:14:32.008 --> 00:14:37.007
Ah! that Debo?
He must be a grown man by now!

123
00:14:37.007 --> 00:14:47.002
Mama, if you see Debo
He's so handsome, and wealthy. Mama, I've hit the jackpot

124
00:14:48.008 --> 00:14:55.006
If you see Debo
He's so fine!

125
00:14:55.006 --> 00:14:57.005
I hope he's not as sturborn 
as he used to be as a child?

126
00:14:57.005 --> 00:15:00.001
No, no ... he's grown.

127
00:15:00.001 --> 00:15:05.001
(flashback)

128
00:15:05.001 --> 00:15:08.006
Debo!Debo!

129
00:15:09.004 --> 00:15:10.001
Goodmorning, Mam.

130
00:15:10.001 --> 00:15:11.000
Amaka, how are you?

131
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.002
I'm fine mam

132
00:15:12.002 --> 00:15:15.007
Debo!
You're keeping your "wife" waiting

133
00:15:15.007 --> 00:15:17.001
Don't you know we're late

134
00:15:17.001 --> 00:15:19.002
Don't mind him!!

135
00:15:19.002 --> 00:15:20.008
Hurry up!

136
00:15:22.003 --> 00:15:25.007
Hey Amaka,
How are you doing?

137
00:15:30.003 --> 00:15:31.003
Bye Bye!

138
00:15:32.004 --> 00:15:38.000
You kow, Amaka
I would like us to have 4 children

139
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.007
Huh! 4 children?
You're funny!

140
00:15:40.007 --> 00:15:43.007
You know I like children?

141
00:15:43.007 --> 00:15:44.008
You're funny.

142
00:15:46.004 --> 00:15:52.002
Amaka, I heard my parents 
talking about us moving

143
00:15:52.002 --> 00:15:57.006
What? why?
Where to?

144
00:15:57.006 --> 00:16:03.005
I dont know
but it seems its going to be far from here

145
00:16:03.005 --> 00:16:05.005
That means we won't be able to see each other again
 
151
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:09,004
Thats what I heard. I'm very sorry, Amaka.

146
00:16:09.004 --> 00:16:10.009
Alright, lets go.

147
00:16:10.009 --> 00:16:17.008
(Amaka is reminesceing)

148
00:16:23.001 --> 00:16:27.004
(flashback - Debo gives Amaka his favourite toy)

149
00:16:40.006 --> 00:16:43.003
(return from flashback Amaka is cuddling the same toy)

150
00:17:30.002 --> 00:17:39.007
(Phone rings)

151
00:17:39.007 --> 00:17:46.002
Hey

152
00:17:46.002 --> 00:17:53.004
Debo: Since I set my eye on you earlier on
Its been hard for me to get you off my mind

153
00:17:53.004 --> 00:18:04.009
O my God!!

154
00:18:04.009 --> 00:18:10.003
I remember every moment we spent together
 
162
00:18:10,003 --> 00:18:13,008
Of course, I remember everything vividly

155
00:18:13.008 --> 00:18:17.009
Yeah, I remember when we were kids and we used
to play arround in the neighbourhood.

156
00:18:17.009 --> 00:18:28.004
And then your mom would send you on an errand

157
00:18:28.004 --> 00:18:34.008
The way we held hands...and moved all around.
We were so happy

158
00:18:34.008 --> 00:18:40.008
(flashback)

159
00:18:40.008 --> 00:18:49.002
Good old days, men, 
good old days.

160
00:18:49.002 --> 00:18:53.000
Amaka, The truth is

161
00:18:55.009 --> 00:19:01.008
I really want to see you

162
00:19:01.008 --> 00:19:05.003
Yes

163
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Alright, I'm looking forward to that

164
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:18.004
Yeah

165
00:19:18.004 --> 00:19:29.001
Bye

166
00:19:43.005 --> 00:19:53.005
(Sola is dreaming about Amaka)

167
00:20:18.009 --> 00:20:22.004
(Sola wakes up)

168
00:21:06.007 --> 00:21:07.003
(Debo and Amaka in bed)

169
00:21:07.003 --> 00:21:11.009
Babe, I swear to you, you're the sweetest

170
00:21:19.004 --> 00:21:24.002
Sweetheart, are you OK?

171
00:21:24.002 --> 00:21:35.003
Sweetheart, are you OK?

172
00:21:38.004 --> 00:21:42.008
I hope I wont be tossed asside 
now that you have become a king?

173
00:21:45.003 --> 00:21:52.003
Baby, I do like the fact 
that you've called me a king though

174
00:21:52.003 --> 00:22:06.007
So I, King Adebowale, I don't toss ladies asside
 
182
00:22:06,007 --> 00:22:21,003
Moreso, this lady is my beautiful queen.
And a beauty like you can never be tossed asside, Okay?

175
00:22:22.006 --> 00:22:25.003
Why should I belive you?

176
00:22:25.003 --> 00:22:38.000
Sweety...I promise you.
There is no woman on earth that can ever take your place

177
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:38.005
Sure?

178
00:22:38.005 --> 00:22:45.009
I swear to you!
Its a promise, okay?

179
00:23:06.006 --> 00:23:10.003
(Sola is practicing what he wants to say to Amaka)

180
00:23:10.003 --> 00:23:15.007
Amaka, 
I've been to the North

181
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:29.000
Amaka,I've been to the South, I've been to the North
I've been to the East and the West

182
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000
I've never seen a lady like you 
in my entire life

183
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:40.002
Amaka,
I've waited so long for this day
 
192
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:45,002
I've never seen any lady like you...

184
00:23:45.002 --> 00:23:49.006
The door to my heart is open

185
00:23:49.006 --> 00:23:57.000
Please come in!

186
00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.009
I love you

187
00:23:58.009 --> 00:24:03.003
I love you so much
And I cannot stop loving you

188
00:24:03.003 --> 00:24:03.003
Please do give me a chance to your heart

189
00:24:12.006 --> 00:24:15.008
(John counghs)

190
00:24:15.008 --> 00:24:17.000
John!

191
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.002
Yes boss.

192
00:24:19.002 --> 00:24:22.001
How long have you been standing here?

193
00:24:22.001 --> 00:24:24.008
Just about 3 minutes now

194
00:24:24.008 --> 00:24:29.007
What?! Why didn't you knock?
 
204
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:35,006
I thought I heard you say come in

195
00:24:35.006 --> 00:24:37.003
But did you knock? For me to say "come in"?

196
00:24:37.003 --> 00:24:41.000
Well I said "Come in", but I wasnt talking to you

197
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.005
I'm sorry sir.

198
00:24:42.005 --> 00:24:45.009
I just heard "Come in" and I decided to let myself in

199
00:24:45.009 --> 00:24:48.003
Erm.. boss, I heard you say stuff like

200
00:24:48.003 --> 00:24:52.002
"I love you..."

201
00:24:52.002 --> 00:24:54.006
"...you are the lady oif my life"

202
00:24:54.006 --> 00:24:56.000
"... you're the world of my life..."

203
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.001
Wait, are you preparing to deliver this speech somewhere?

204
00:24:59.001 --> 00:25:00.008
I'm not preparing any speech.

205
00:25:00.008 --> 00:25:04.003
Forget about it, you can't understand

206
00:25:04.003 --> 00:25:08.006
Oh I undestand...
